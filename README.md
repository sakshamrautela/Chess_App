# **Public Disclosure Document**

**Title:** Adaptive Chess Training System: Personalized Skill Evaluation and Improvement Platform  
 **Inventor:** Saksham Rautela  
 **Date of Public Disclosure:** October 5, 2025  
 **Disclaimer:** This document is a public disclosure of an original invention idea for the purpose of establishing prior art. It is **not a patent application**. The information contained herein is voluntarily and publicly shared to place this concept in the public domain.

## **Abstract**

This disclosure describes an AI-based chess improvement system that personalizes gameplay and training using adaptive learning algorithms. The invention continuously evaluates a player’s strength during active play, adjusts the AI opponent’s style to match the player’s ability, and generates individualized training content. It also allows for the import and analysis of games from third-party chess platforms.

---

## **Background**

Traditional chess improvement tools either rely on static difficulty levels or provide generic post-game analysis. These systems fail to adapt to the player’s learning curve in real time and offer limited personalization. The disclosed invention aims to close this gap by merging **adaptive gameplay, real-time evaluation, and personalized training guidance** into one integrated system.

---

## **Summary of the Invention**

The proposed system introduces a **dynamic chess training platform** combining an AI opponent with a customized feedback engine. Its unique innovation lies in its continuous, in-game evaluation mechanism and its ability to translate that analysis into actionable, player-specific training recommendations.

## **Detailed Description**

### **1\. Adaptive Playing Bot**

* The AI engine evaluates the user’s performance every **five moves**.

* Based on tactical accuracy, time usage, and positional understanding, the system computes a **temporary skill rating**.

* The bot’s parameters (aggression level, calculation depth, and style preference) are then modified to reflect the user’s current strength.

* This creates a self-adjusting gameplay experience that maintains the ideal level of challenge.

### **2\. Personalized Training Plan**

* After each completed game, the system generates a **custom training plan**.

* It highlights the player’s most frequent errors—such as tactical blunders, miscalculations, poor time control, or strategic misjudgments.

* Based on this classification, the app suggests **targeted puzzles**, **thematic lessons**, or **annotated master games** for review.

### **3\. Game Import and Categorization**

* Users can **import PGN files** or connect their **Chess.com** or **Lichess** accounts.

* The engine analyzes these external games using its internal evaluation model.

* Mistakes are categorized into learning areas, such as:

  * Tactical oversight

  * Positional misunderstanding

  * Opening inaccuracies

  * Endgame inefficiency

* Each category links to recommended study materials or problem sets.

### **4\. Continuous Learning Loop**

* The player’s **skill profile** is stored and updated after every session.

* Over time, the AI refines both the playing bot and the training plan using accumulated data.

* This creates a **longitudinal improvement model**, allowing measurable tracking of progress.

---

## **Key Features**

* Real-time adaptive difficulty tuning during gameplay.

* Continuous skill assessment and progress tracking.

* Custom-generated puzzles and study plans aligned with player weaknesses.

* Integration with existing online chess platforms for data continuity.

* Application of machine learning for personalized improvement strategies.

---

## **Potential Applications**

* Personalized chess coaching and training.

* AI-assisted education and sports analytics.

* Integration into e-learning systems for cognitive skill development.

---

## **Claims (Informal)**

1. A system that evaluates player strength during active chess play and dynamically adjusts the AI opponent’s behavior based on said evaluation.

2. A method of generating customized training plans derived from categorized gameplay errors.

3. An integration framework that imports external chess games, classifies player mistakes, and provides targeted study recommendations.
